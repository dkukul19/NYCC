He is positioned to the left, and to his right, there is a barrel with a large, open spout. Further to the right, two men are standing, one of whom is carrying a baby. They are looking towards the left, away from the seated man. In the background, there is a structure that could be a part of a ship or a building, and it is adorned with what appears to be a window and a decorative element. Below the scene, there is a signature or logo that reads \"KUNSTLER\". The setting suggests a nautical or coastal theme."

The scroll has some text on it, but it's not clear from the image what that text says. The man is dressed in what appears to be historical or biblical-era clothing, with a long robe and a head covering. Behind him, there is a crowd of people, who seem to be listening to him or watching him read from the scroll. The setting appears to be an outdoor area, possibly a public or open space, given the presence of a crowd."

At the center, a large anchor with an exaggerated size compared to the human figures is seen hanging from the ceiling, causing a slight disruption in the room. The room appears to be a bakery or cafe, given the presence of breads and cakes on shelves in the background. There are four people in the scene, each with different expressions and actions, which adds to the chaotic yet amusing atmosphere of the drawing. The characters are looking up at the anchor, suggesting surprise or confusion, and the overall setting seems to be indoors with a casual, everyday feel."
